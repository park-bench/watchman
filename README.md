# clover

_clover_ monitors a camera for motion and sends encrypted e-mails containing
images of the area being monitored as long as motion is detected.

Relies on the _timber_ logging library which can be found at 
https://github.com/park-bench/timber
Also depends on our _confighelper_ library which can be found at
https://github.com/park-bench/confighelper
Also depends on our _gpgmailer_ daemon which can be found at
https://github.com/park-bench/gpgmailer

clover is licensed under the GNU GPLv3.

Bug fixes are welcome.
