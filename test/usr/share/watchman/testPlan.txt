* Frames are captured for the first e-mail and first e-mail is sent.
* Frames are captured for the second e-mail and second e-mail is sent.
* Frames are captured for the third e-mail and third e-mail is sent.
* Frames are captured for subsequent e-mails and subsequent e-mails are sent.
* E-mails are sent at approximately the right times.
* Subsequent e-mails keep getting sent as long as motion keeps occurring.
* E-mails stop when motion stops.
* Images are saved to disk at the right frequency.
* Images saved to disk can be opened.
* Images in e-mails can be opened.
* Still running notification is sent at approximately the right times.
* Still running notification's contents is accurate (readable).
* Background can drastically change and motion is no longer detected (if there is no motion).
* Program kinda resets after there hasn't been motion for a long time and everything above works when motion is reintroduced.

* Verify the initial frame skip count is recognized.
* Try adjusting prior_movements_per_threshold to their minimum values if they are not there already.
* E-mail image is resized if it is greater than maximum width.
* Image saved to disk can be rotated 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees.
* Image e-mailed can be rotated 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees.
